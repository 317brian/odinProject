  <title>Basic tomato sauce (The Bear)</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>The sauce from <i>The Bear</i> is great cause it combines two iconic recipes but remains unfussy and easy to whip together on a week night.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
     <li>28 oz can of whole tomatoes that you actually like. I like Cento and the Kirkland Signature San Marzano's. Use Pom√¨ if you're feeling spendy.</li>
  </ul>
